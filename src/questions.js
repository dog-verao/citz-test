    "explanation": "While the source shows a picture of the 1965 flag and mentions it under Canadian Symbols, it doesn't explicitly state what it symbolizes. However, the overall theme of the Symbols section is explaining national identity. The previous Red Ensign served as the national flag for 100 years. The 1965 flag is the current national flag. A reasonable inference supported by the text's structure is that the modern flag is a key symbol of Canadian identity. Rechecking source... The section title is 'Canadian Symbols - Together they help explain what it means to be Canadian and express our national identity'. This confirms the purpose of the symbols discussed. Therefore, the flag, as a prominent symbol, contributes to expressing national identity."
